# Weather-Dashboard

Deployed application can be found at : 

## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a program that retrieves weather data for cities.

Page runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Weather data retrieved using [OpenWeatherMap_API](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5).

Through this project, I learnt a lot about Javascript, working with APIs, LocalStorage, and how to ensure a program's logic is as sharp as possible.

## Installation

N/A, a web browser will do.

## Usage

To use the program, enter a city of your choosing and click 'search'. The weather forecast for today and the next few days will be revealed.

Recent searches will be saved under the search bar. Clicking them will reveal the information for the targeted city once more.

## Credits

The bootcamp for teaching me the skills required for this project, Jesus Christ our Lord, and lastly myself, ExxtremeBattler
